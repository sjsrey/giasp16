<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial
data analysis. The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects
of spatial statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on the
computational aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)
methods for three different types of spatial data: point processes,
lattice, and geostatistical. Throughout the course you will gain
valuable hands-on experience with several specialized software packages
for spatial data analysis. The overriding goal of the course is for you
to acquire familiarity with the fundamental methodological and
operational issues in the statistical analysis of geographic information
and the ability to extend these methods in your own research.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>All participants are expected to have working knowledge of spatial
analysis concepts and to be familiar with multivariate statistics. No
extensive GIS background beyond ArcGIS/QGIS basics is needed.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grading will be assigned on the following scale: A: 90-100, B: 80-89,
C:70-79, D: 60-69, E below 60. There will be no curves. I will
assign +/- on an individual basis. Points are assigned as follows:</p>

<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<p>Quizzes based on the assigned lectures and readings will be given during
the first five minutes of class meetings. No makeups for quizzes will be
given.</p>
<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>A series of graded exercises will be given for each of the major topics which
focus on the mechanics of carrying out an analysis. Your exercises will be
introduced in the second half of the class meeting and are to be completed on
your own time outside of class. You are encouraged to work collaboratively on
the exercises while keeping in mind that you are responsible for understanding
the completed exercise as these will stress methods you will need to apply in
your project (see below). We will have a minimum of 8 weekly exercises, graded
on a pass-fail basis. To obtain credit for the exercise component of the course
you must succesffully complete 4 of these. Failure to do so will result in a 0
on the exercise component and a failing grade for the course.</p>
<h3>Project/Presentations</h3>
<p>All students will 
Graduate students are required to carry out a small research project
that applies a selection of the methods covered in the course to a
problem in their area of research. Graduate students are required to carry out
an independent project that they will  present at the end of the semester.
Undergraduate students have the option of working in a team or indivdually, and
may present their project for extra credit.  Details on the projects will be given
out early in the semester.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>This semester we will be covering conceptual material through lectures on Tuesdays, while Thursdays will be dedicated towards computationally based learning. More specifically, on Thursdays we will engage in the following activities </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>short quizzes (each meeting)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>student initiated discussions of lecture/reading materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exploration of spatial analysis methods through open source software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>group work on exercises</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>individualized work on projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>other learning activities as we discover them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Classroom etiquette</h2>
<p>To ensure a productive learning environment, all participants are
expected to abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because we are meeting in a computer laboratory food is strictly
    forbidden in the class meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of the classroom computers should only be in support of the
    course. Extracurricular use (i.e., browsing non-course materials,
    using social networks, checking email, chat sessions, etc. during
    class meetings is disruptive for your colleagues and disrespectful.
    Individuals violating this rule will be asked to leave for that
    course session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>While this course does not have a formal lab unit, in the sense that you
would get an additional credit unit, the course material lends itself
rather nicely to computationally based instruction. We will utilize a
set of <a href="http://www.opensource.org">open source</a> software packages that
you can put on your own (or a friend’s) computer to work on the examples
and exercises in support of the course material. We will set aside part
of the lectures to demonstrate various capabilities of these software
packages to support spatial analysis. You will have additional
opportunity to apply these methods both in the individual exercises. We
will rely on two main packages. The first is
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> which is freely available and runs on a
number of platforms, including Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, and Windows (all
flavors). It is a very powerful mathematical programming language with
many data analysis, graphical and computational functions. The second
package is <a href="http://pysal.org/">PySAL</a> which is a Python library for
spatial data analysis and geocomputation. <strong>We will cover installation
of these packages early in the semester and you are strongly encouraged
to bring your own laptop to class so that you may work with these
packages outside of the classroom availability.</strong></p>
<h2>Readings</h2>
<p>Video assignments listed on Blackboard are to be completed prior to the
class meeting. Assigned readings are listed in Table [tab:schedule] and
are also to be done prior to class meeting. The majority of these are
taken from:</p>
<ul>
<li>David O’Sullivan and David J. Unwin (2010) <em>Geographic Information
    Analysis</em>, Wiley: Hoboken. Second edition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional readings will be assigned by topic.</p>
<h2>Academic integrity</h2>
<p>The ASU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into five broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating on an academic evaluation or assignment,
plagiarizing, academic deceit, such as fabricating data or information,
aiding academic integrity policy violations and inappropriately
collaborating, or falsifying academic records. For more information
about the ASU student academic integrity policy, please use the
following web link <a href="http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity">http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity</a></p>
<h2>Disability accommodations</h2>
<p>Qualified students with disabilities who will require disability
accommodations in this class are encouraged to make their requests to me
at the beginning of the semester either during office hours or by
appointment. Note: Prior to receiving disability accommodations,
verification of eligibility from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) is
required. Disability information is confidential.</p>
