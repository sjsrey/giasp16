##Introduction

The purpose of this course is to introduce you to methods of spatial
data analysis. The focus is on both the conceptual and applied aspects
of spatial statistical methods. We will place particular emphasis on the
computational aspects of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)
methods for three different types of spatial data: point processes,
lattice, and geostatistical. Throughout the course you will gain
valuable hands-on experience with several specialized software packages
for spatial data analysis. The overriding goal of the course is for you
to acquire familiarity with the fundamental methodological and
operational issues in the statistical analysis of geographic information
and the ability to extend these methods in your own research.

##Prerequisites
The formal prerequisite for this course is [GIS 470 Statistics for Geographers][470].
All participants are expected to have working knowledge of spatial
analysis concepts and to be familiar with multivariate statistics. No
extensive GIS background beyond ArcGIS/QGIS basics is needed.

##Grading
Grading will be assigned on the following scale: A: 90-100, B: 80-89,
C:70-79, D: 60-69, E below 60. There will be no curves. I will
assign +/- on an individual basis. Points are assigned as follows:

| Component    |    G471 |    G598 |
|:-------------|--------:|--------:|
| Quizzes      |      30 |      20 |
| Exercises    |      40 |      40 |
| Project      |      30 |      30 |
| Presentation |       - |      10 |
| Total        |     100 |     100 |


###Quizzes
Quizzes based on the assigned lectures and readings will be given during
the first five minutes of class meetings. No makeups for quizzes will be
given.

###Exercises

A series of graded exercises will be given for each of the major topics which
focus on the mechanics of carrying out an analysis. Your exercises will be
introduced in the second half of the class meeting and are to be completed on
your own time outside of class. You are encouraged to work collaboratively on
the exercises while keeping in mind that you are responsible for understanding
the completed exercise as these will stress methods you will need to apply in
your project (see below). We will have a minimum of 8 weekly exercises, graded
on a 10-point scale. To obtain credit for the exercise component of the course
you must successfully complete 4 of these. Failure to do so will result in a 0
on the exercise component and a failing grade for the course.




###Project/Presentations
All students will carry out a small research project
that applies a selection of the methods covered in the course to a
problem in their area of research. Graduate students are required to carry out
an independent project that they will  present at the end of the semester.
Undergraduate students have the option of working in a team or indivdually, and
may present their project for extra credit.  Details on the projects will be given
out early in the semester.


## Organization

This semester we will be covering conceptual material through lectures on Tuesdays, while Thursdays will be dedicated towards computationally based learning. More specifically, on Thursdays we will engage in the following activities 

-   short quizzes (each meeting)

-   exploration of spatial analysis methods through open source software

-   group work on exercises

-   individualized work on projects

-   student initiated discussions of lecture/reading materials

-   other learning activities as we discover them

## Classroom etiquette
To ensure a productive learning environment, all participants are
expected to abide by the following rules:

-   Because we are meeting in a computer laboratory food is strictly
    forbidden in the class meetings.

-   Use of the classroom computers should only be in support of the
    course. Extracurricular use (i.e., browsing non-course materials,
    using social networks, checking email, chat sessions, etc. during
    class meetings is disruptive for your colleagues and disrespectful.
    Individuals violating this rule will be asked to leave for that
    course session.

## Software
While this course does not have a formal lab unit, in the sense that you would
get an additional credit unit, the course material lends itself rather nicely
to computationally based instruction. We will utilize a set of [open
source](http://www.opensource.org) software packages that you can put on your
own (or a friend’s) computer to work on the examples and exercises in support
of the course material. We will set aside part of the lectures to demonstrate
various capabilities of these software packages to support spatial analysis.
You will have additional opportunity to apply these methods both in the
individual exercises. We will mainly rely on [PySAL](http://pysal.org/) which
is a Python library for spatial data analysis and geocomputation. PySAL is is
freely available and runs on a number of platforms, including Linux, Unix, Mac
OS X, and Windows (all flavors).   **We will cover
[installation]({filename}tools.md) of these packages early in the semester and
you are strongly encouraged to bring your own laptop to class so that you may
work with these packages outside of the classroom availability.**

## Readings
Assigned readings are listed in the [Schedule]({filename}01_schedule.md) and
are be done prior to class meeting. The majority of these are taken from:

-   David O’Sullivan and David J. Unwin (2014) *Geographic Information
    Analysis*, Wiley: Hoboken. Second edition. Available to ASU students [on-line][ou].

Additional readings will be assigned by topic.

## Academic integrity 

The ASU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into five broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating on an academic evaluation or assignment,
plagiarizing, academic deceit, such as fabricating data or information,
aiding academic integrity policy violations and inappropriately
collaborating, or falsifying academic records. For more information
about the ASU student academic integrity policy, please use the
following web link <http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity>

## Disability accommodations 

Qualified students with disabilities who will require disability
accommodations in this class are encouraged to make their requests to me
at the beginning of the semester either during office hours or by
appointment. Note: Prior to receiving disability accommodations,
verification of eligibility from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) is
required. Disability information is confidential.
